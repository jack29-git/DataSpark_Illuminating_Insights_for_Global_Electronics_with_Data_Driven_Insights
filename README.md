Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, is committed to leveraging data-driven strategies to enhance its competitive edge. Through this project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract actionable insights from diverse datasets encompassing customer demographics, product details, sales performance, store operations, and currency exchange rates. These insights will enable Global Electronics to refine its marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and make data-informed decisions on product development and store expansion. Additionally, by understanding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations, the company can strengthen its international pricing strategies. Ultimately, this project strives to enhance customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and drive sustainable business growth in a competitive retail environment.
